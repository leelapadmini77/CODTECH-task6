‚ú≥Ô∏è Detailed Problem Statement: Gesture-Controlled Web App for Basic Laptop/PC Functions
‚úÖ Background & Context
In our daily interaction with computers, traditional input devices like keyboards, mice, and touchpads have been the default modes of control. While effective, they rely on direct physical interaction, which is not always ideal or possible.

Certain scenarios highlight the limitations of these traditional input methods:

During presentations, the speaker may want to control slides or media from a distance.

In healthcare or cleanroom environments, physical contact must be minimized for hygiene.

For people with physical disabilities, using a keyboard or mouse may be difficult or impossible.

In public kiosks or shared computers, users may prefer touchless interaction to avoid germ transmission.

These examples point to a need for an alternative, contactless, and intuitive interaction system that allows users to control their devices without physical touch.

üí° The Need for Gesture-Based Interaction
Gestures are a natural and universally understood form of communication. Using hand gestures to interact with devices can provide:

Hands-free control in active or movement-constrained environments

Accessibility for users with mobility challenges

Hygienic operation in sensitive or shared spaces

Futuristic and intuitive UX that feels modern and engaging

With the advancement of computer vision and machine learning in the browser, it's now possible to achieve this using just a webcam and a web browser‚Äîwithout installing any extra software or hardware.

üéØ Goal of the Project
The project aims to develop a web-based application that enables users to control basic laptop or PC functions using hand gestures detected through their webcam. The app should:

Detect and recognize hand gestures in real time

Map gestures to essential functions like:

Volume up/down

Play/pause media

Switch browser tabs

Run entirely within a browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

Be lightweight and responsive for real-world use

Provide a simple and clean UI for ease of use

This will improve accessibility, promote hygienic computing, and offer an alternative interaction model that is modern and flexible.

‚öôÔ∏è Example Use Case Scenarios
A teacher in a classroom waves a hand to switch slides without touching the keyboard.

A nurse in a sterile room uses gestures to play a tutorial video.

A person with a disability uses gestures to control media playback on their PC.

üöß Challenges Being Addressed
Eliminating the need for external hardware (e.g., no Leap Motion or Kinect)

Providing a touch-free, browser-based interface with no software installation

Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and low latency performance

Mapping gestures reliably to real-world PC functions using only JavaScript and web APIs
